In this example, we are considering a 2-d square lattice represented by a rectangular unit cell with 2 atoms:

--------------------
|* *| * *| * *| * *| 
--------------------
|* *| * *| * *| * *| 
--------------------
|* *| * *| * *| * *| 
--------------------
|* *| * *| * *| * *| 
--------------------

The scripts rely on the folder structure given in this example folder. So we recommend you to follow the same structure containing the following folders:
   inputfiles
   outputfiles
   spirit_output
   temp

All inputcards have a posfix that helps you to label your simulation. In our case, it is Mn5Ge3. You can choose your own (by renaming all inputcards) but you can not have space or _ in this prefix.

Update the "interaction_pairs_file" path in the spirit inputfile "input_Mn5Ge3.cfg"

Files that you might want to edit in the SWIS inputfile "inputcard_Mn5Ge3.inp": 

   basisname   = "spirit_output/spinconfig_final.ovf" (Use spirit to generate this)
   pairfile    = "inputfiles/pair_temp.txt"
   latticefile = "inputfiles/lattice.dat"

Match primitive vectors between the SWIS and Spirit inputfiles.

If you change some parameter such as the magnetic field, you need to edit by hand both spirit and the SWIS inputfiles making them to match.

Before running the code for the first time, you might need to configure the section "--- Setup environment ---" in the SWIS running script "runspinwave.sh"

Run the code with "./runspinwave.sh Mn5Ge3"
