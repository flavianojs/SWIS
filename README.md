# SWIS: Spin Wave and Inelastic Scattering

**SWIS** is a code package for computing **spin-wave dispersion** and **spin-polarized inelastic scattering spectra** of **noncollinear magnetic systems**.  
It was written and developed by **Flaviano José dos Santos**.

---

## Features
- Calculation of spin-wave dispersion for general noncollinear magnetic states.
- Computation of spin-polarized inelastic neutron scattering spectra.
- Flexible setup for different lattice geometries and interaction parameters.
- Designed for research on frustrated magnets, complex spin textures, and more.
